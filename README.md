# Tuition Reimbursement Management System

## Project Description

The Tuition Reimbursement System, TRMS, allows users to submit reimbursements for courses and training. The submitted reimbursement must be approved by that employee's supervisor, department head, and benefits coordinator. The benefits coordinator then reviews the grade received before finalizing the reimbursement.

## Technologies Used

* AWS S3 Integration for File Upload
* RESTful API built with Javalin
* Data persistence through AWS Keystore for Apache Cassandra
* Logging with Log4J2
* Unit testing with JUnit

## Features

* Complete TRMS approval process
* File upload to skip supervisor approval
* Discrete Data Access layer
